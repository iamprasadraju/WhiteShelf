description: "The textbook spans the biological basis of behavior, from the molecular mechanisms
  of neurons to higher cognitive functions. It synthesizes neuroanatomy, physiology,
  biochemistry, and psychology to explain how neural circuits give rise to perception,
  movement, emotion, and thought. Each edition reflects advances in neural imaging,
  genetics, and computational neuroscience."
