description: "The book introduces mathematical tools for analyzing the nervous system, bridging
  the gap between neurobiology and theoretical modeling. It emphasizes quantitative
  approaches to understanding neural coding, dynamics, and plasticity. By deriving
  principles from first-order models to network-level behavior, the text establishes
  a rigorous framework for linking brain function to computation."
