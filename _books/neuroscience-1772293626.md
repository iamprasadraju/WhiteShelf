description: "'Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain surveys the organization and function of the
  human nervous system. We present material at the cutting edge of neuroscience in
  a way that is accessible to both science and nonscience students alike. The level
  of the material is comparable to an introductory college text in general biology.
  The book is divided into four parts: Part I, Foundations; Part II, Sensory and Motor
  Systems; Part III, The Brain and Behavior; and Part IV, The Changing Brain. We begin
  Part I by introducing the modern field of neuroscience and tracing some of its historical
  antecedents. Then we take a close look at the structure and function of individual
  neurons, how they communicate chemically, and how these building blocks are arranged
  to form a nervous system. In Part II, we go inside the brain to examine the structure
  and function of the systems that serve the senses and command voluntary movements.
  In Part III, we explore the neurobiology of human behavior, including motivation,
  sex, emotion, sleep, language, attention, and mental illness. Finally, in Part IV,
  we look at how the environment modifies the brain, both during development and in
  adult learning and memory - Provided by publisher.'"
