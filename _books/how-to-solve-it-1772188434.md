description: "A perennial bestseller by eminent mathematician G. Polya, How to Solve It will
  show anyone in any field how to think straight. In lucid and appealing prose, Polya
  reveals how the mathematical method of demonstrating a proof or finding an unknown
  can be of help in attacking any problem that can be “reasoned” out—from building
  a bridge to winning a game of anagrams. Generations of readers have relished Polya’s
  deft—indeed, brilliant—instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going straight
  to the heart of the problem."
