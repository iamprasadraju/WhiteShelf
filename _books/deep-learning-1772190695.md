description: "Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from
  experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because
  the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer
  operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy
  of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out
  of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book
  introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning."
