description: "The text covers the biophysics of single neurons, synaptic interactions, and the
  emergent dynamics of neuronal populations. It bridges the gap between detailed cellular
  modeling and abstract representations used in systems and cognitive neuroscience.
  Mathematical formulations—differential equations, stochastic processes, and mean-field
  theory—are presented alongside conceptual explanations."
