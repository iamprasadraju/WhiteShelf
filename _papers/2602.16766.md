summary: |
  We present the results of the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field), a survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc) over roughly $3,000$ square degrees, focusing on the field dwarf population. Candidates are detected using a semi-automated algorithm tailored for low surface brightness dwarfs. Using tests with injected galaxies, we show the detection is $50\%$ complete to $m_g\sim20$ mag and $M_\star \sim 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Candidates are confirmed to be true nearby dwarfs through distance measurements including redshift, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations. We identify isolated, field dwarfs using various environmental criteria. Over the survey footprint, we detect and confirm 95 LV dwarfs, 44 of which we consider isolated. Using this sample, we infer the field dwarf mass function and find good agreement at the high-mass end with previous redshift surveys and with the predictions of the IllustrisTNG simulation. This sample of isolated, field dwarfs represents a powerful dataset to investigate aspects of small-scale structure and the effect of environment on dwarf galaxy evolution.
